Sanity of aiscs 
1. Customer
   
   date and time format is different and many of the column doesn't tend to0 have time in them.
   most the phone numbers include 91- as the country code
   customer_id is missing that is no issue i guess as we have phone number to give as a primary key.

2. order_item 
   line_item_id - nullable false

3. product 
   one product of different size is listed with one product id since product id is a unique key here we need to delete all the duplicate file. 

   hence looking good

4. Refunded
   headers are different we have rename the headers.
   requested Amount and refunded amount is different we only take amount as a input which amount is we should take\
